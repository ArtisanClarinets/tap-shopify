## Installation
Use pip to install a release from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Matatika/tap-shopify@vx.x.x
```

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:

```bash
tap-shopify --about
```

### Source Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` If your tap requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-shopify` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-shopify --version
tap-shopify --help
tap-shopify --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` As a first step, scan the entire project for the text "`TODO:`" and complete any recommended steps, deleting the "TODO" references once completed.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_shopify/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-shopify` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-shopify --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any additional plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-shopify
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-shopify --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-shopify target-jsonl
```
